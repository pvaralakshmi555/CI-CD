**🚀 Real-World Software Pipeline Simulation Using Python Abstraction**

This project simulates a real-world software development pipeline, illustrating how software, data engineering, and ML teams collaborate through a structured, version-controlled, and abstracted codebase.

**🎯 Key Objectives**

✅ Demonstrate modular code division across team roles 
✅ Showcase how abstraction drives clean integration and extensibility
✅ Emulate real-world CI/CD workflows using GitHub

**👥 Team Simulation & Role Responsibilities**

**Role Responsibility File**

👨‍💼 Senior Developer Defines abstract skeleton using base classes Version1.py 
👨‍💻 Junior Developer Implements core logic via inheritance Version2.py
🧪 Tester / User Runs the complete pipeline through CLI main_version2.py

🔁 Versioned Development Workflow Version Role Description V1 Senior Dev Creates abstract class structure (Version1.py) V2 Junior Dev Implements working logic (Version2.py) V3 Senior Dev Adds new abstract methods for extension V4 Junior Dev Implements added features from V3

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used Python OOP with Abstract Base Classes (abc)

Clean, modular, and scalable architecture

Command-Line Interface (CLI) using argparse

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for Object Detection

✨ Designed for clarity — the full pipeline runs via CLI without needing to read internal logic.
